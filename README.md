*Apptendance* is an attendance tracking iOS app written in Objective-C.  The features of the app organizes groups.  In each group, a list of names can be maintained.  After the lists of names are created, the user can simply select a name to mark the person for attendance.  Additionally, the user can save a report of current attendance status for tracking purposes.

### Features
Organize lists of multiple attendance containers.  This is useful for situations such as managing multiple classrooms, multiple groups or just dividing long lists into smaller, more managable lists (such as a *Male* and *Female* list).
